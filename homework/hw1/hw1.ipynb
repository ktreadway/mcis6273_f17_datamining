    "the `hw1.ipynb` file in the `homework/hw1` directory.  If you do not know\n",

    "A great deal of time doing data mining involves understanding the data in a dataset and preprocessing it in preparation for working with it in a real analysis of some sort.  We will develop an understanding of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * how to empirically perform and understand the descriptive statistics of a dataset,\n",
    "  * understand how to reason about data features,\n",
    "  * understand how to use distance metrics,\n",

    "We'll be working a new  much smaller dataset for this task.  Please check the repository for the `bank.csv` data set.  There are fewer than 1000 rows to work with in this data.  You will need to use [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for all the questions here, and it is recommended you take a look at the optional cheat sheets [for lecture 2 in the syllabus](https://kmsaumcis.gitbub.io/mcis6273_f17_datamining/syllabus).\n",

    "&#167;  In the readings and lecture, we talked about distributions of data.  Please produce the frequency distribution (histogram) for the following:  (1) rural income, (2) car ownership age.
